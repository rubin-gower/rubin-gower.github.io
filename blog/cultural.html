   		  <h1>personal values</h1>
 <p> my personal value i find important is Adventure as you have to be able to understand meany different things before you set your mind on something. for example trying a bunch of different things before you decide to commit time to it like studying IT.</p>


<p>my strengths are i have been learning web development at college. as for my limitations i am not that great at english as i have dyslexia 
when trying to work with people with resistance or tension i find the best way is to just leave it and avoid provoking eachother</p>
