     <h1>personal values</h1>
     <p> my personal value i find important is Adventure as you have to be able to understand meany different things before you set your mind on something. for example trying a bunch of different things before you decide to commit time to it like studying IT.</p>


     <p>my strengths are i have been learning web development at college. as for my limitations i am not that great at english as i have dyslexia 
     when trying to work with people with resistance or tension i find the best way is to just leave it and avoid provoking eachother</p>

       now that i know its important to plan the website before adding random things i definity could have saved lots of time</p>




       <p><b># Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</b></p>

       <p><b>### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </b>
       css makes things look amazing and colorfull but without html its usless </p>


       <p><b>### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? </b>
       my main problem i had was geting stuck on my design and not knowing where to go as i had not made a plan. i ended up playing around for a while till i had somthing i liked. i will definity plan my website next time</p>

      no</p>

      <p><b>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   </b>
      it feels like a waist of time as you coud be geting stuff done but without it i tend to get distracted more</p>

      <p><b>What did you notice as you were meditating? </b>
      it was nice to have a break from thinking about important things</p>

      <p><b>How did you find the overall experience? </b>
      it was good to try relax and try not to worrie about stuff</p>

      <p><b>What's your daily habit commitment? </b>
      to spend more time off screens and just thinking </p>

      <h2>Listening and Looping </h2>

      <p><b>What was it like to be fully listened to? </b>
      missed this</p>

      <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>

      <p><b>What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? </b>
      i just used the given seorces and w3 schools when i got stuck</p>

      <p><b>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</b>
      yes i keeped with the time box</p>

      <p><b>If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  </b>
      i got stuck with the names of the event listeners as they didnt have names like rightclick and had context menu instead</p>

      <h2>The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer</h2>

      <p><b>Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?
      i fell like i mostly have an undestanding of the dom in the past as to use css u need a little understanding e.g. changing the background and then changing a div. </b>
    i thought the node part was intresting as i have never heard of it before </p>

    <p><b>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</b>

    i try just keep one studdy tab open at a time just to keep things simple</p>

    <h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>

    <p><b>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?</b>
    i feel like i have only scratched the surface of the dom and if i reserched more it would get extreamly complicated fast. but for the most part it was simple enough to get an understanding</p>

    <p><b>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</b>
    i didnt get stuck at all </p>

    <p><b>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.</b>
    yeah it was fun to change things like colors on a page</p>

      <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p><b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b>
      According to studies by Carol Dweck having an understanding of neuroplasticity can help students understand there brain in not fixed. Its actually able to learn new things and change the way we already do them. For example someone with the mindset that they are dumb can understand that the brain dosnt work that way and they can learn much better.</p>

      <p><b>Discuss how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b>
      Understanding neuroplasticity can be extremely helpful for me as i struggle with dyslexia and have tried programs like this in the past to change the way i think and it has definitely helped</p>

      <p><b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</b>
      Being open minded to change and not giving up will definitely help as you know it will just be practice that strengthens your neuroplasticity</p>

      <p><b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b>
        https://www.lexercise.com/blog/neuroplasticity-research-on-dyslexia
      This was interesting as it says people with dyslexia have less neuroplasticity. This is why dyslexics have trouble with reading as you have to convey the letters to sounds then words</p>

      <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p><b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b>
      Growth mindset is like the willingness to learn. If you're doing something and think it's useless and a waste of your time you won't learn. You have to engage and try to learn. This is important for web development as as there is so many ways to do the same thing you have to be open minded to adapt to the fast changing web development</p>

      <p><b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
      I was kind of interested that it said it was good to struggle as i have always thought work smart not hard and try avoid things that are too challenging so this was good to learn</p>

      <p><b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
      Understanding that struggle is a good thing as once you serpase it the results will be much better than trying to avoid it</p>

      <p><b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b>
        https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/
      I thought i was interesting as it talks about people working hard to get validation from others and have them recognize there achievements.</p>

<h2># Code Readability Primer<h2>
<p><h3>### What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?</h3>
The main part of readability i want to add to my code is the indenting as i have a bad habit of not doing it and my code is unreadable</p>

<p><h3>### Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.</h3>
It's important to make your code readable as code needs to be read back by you and others.
Ways to make it readable is to make the variables and function names understandable so you know what they are rather than just x. It also helps to comment on code that way anyone reading the code can tell what you're trying to do. Formatting your code right with indenting to make it easier on the eye to see what goes where.</p>

<h2># Code Readability Challenge</h2>
<p><h3>### As a developer, how important do you think indenting is?</h3>
I used to not do it but i find it much easier to read my own code now that i have started and some languages u have to do it or the code gets confused</p>

<p><h3>### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?</h3>
I prefer tabs as its nice easily making it inline and spaced enough to see</p>

<p><h3>### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that? Is your _downloads_ folder a reflection of that?</h3>
I like to keep my work space clean in real life but as for my computer its always been a complete mess and my computer struggles with all the desktop icons i have.</p>

<p><h3># Testing

```
function testSum(){
var expected = 7
var actual = sum(5, 2)

if (actual != expected) {
console.log("It's broken..")
} else {
console.log("It works!")
}
}
```

Have a go at writing a function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:</h3> 
function sum(x, y) {
return x + y
}

<p><h3>### Do you think you would prefer using Unit Testing or Test Driven Development? Why?</h3>
Probably test driven as i know more about it </p>

<p><h3>### How could these techniques be used together to make code that is reliable?</h3>
Unit testing is useful as your testing small parts of your program as to no go too far on in your program to realize it doesn't work. Test driven or more for the final product to make sure it works</p>

<p><h3>### Was your initial response to the idea of testing, "That sounds useful" or "That sounds like a hassle"? Why?</h3>
I find testing useful as without it it would be almost impossible to code but i really didn't like the test driven development as i found myself wring segiti code just to fit requirements rather than make the code clean and smart</p>

<p><h3># Repl.it - Code in your browser
### What was your first impression of the Repl.it website?</h3>
At first i found it really useful until i came across a bug where my code won't run and wouldn't update which made it really hard. I also found it hard to tell what was going on because i couldn't clear the console so i ended up doing most of it in my own editor</p>

<p><h3>### How did you find using it in practice? Confusing? Useful?</h3>
I was nice to have that layout as it was so easy to make changes and see them </p>

<p><h3>### When you say the name of the website in your head, how are you pronouncing it? "REPLIT"? "REP-ILL-IT"? "REPELL-IT"?</h3>
rep-ill-it</p>

<h2># Problem Solving and Pseudocode </h2>
<p><h3>### Pick two problem solving techniques you would like to put into practice. Which ones have you chosen?</h3>
I like the rubber ducky method and googling as if its a technical problem i can google and if its a logic problem then i use the rubber ducky</p>

<p><h3>### How will you implement these techniques into your day to day coding flow? How will you make sure that you actually do them?</h3>
I have already got use to the googling method but i still find rubber ducky word as i normally just call a friend over and that's how i use it</p>

<h2># JavaScript Variables and Object Types</h2>
<p><h3>### How did you find working through the Variables and Objects kata?</h3>
I found this one super easy and had it done it 20 mins</p>

<p><h3>### Did you look at the tests while coding the kata? Was it helpful?</h3>
I found it easy to go though the test and get four to pass at once</p>

<h2># Manipulating JavaScript Objects</h2>
<p><h3>### What was the highlight of this kata for you?</h3>
I did struggle at one point with the syntax of objects inside objects and took a while to figure out</p>

<p><h3>### Did you find you preferred following the steps given to you or using the test outputs in your repl? Why?</h3>
I liked to just see the output and then focus on the next task</p>


<h2># FizzBuzz (Super Edition)</h2>
<p><h3>### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?</h3>
As normal as fix buzz was i struggled on this one the most as i would have coded it a different way and got really confused at the way the test driven development was trying to guide me</p>

<p><h3>### How did you find using pseudocode during this kata?</h3>
Very difficult as i realized i would have done it a different way and following the code was hard</p>

<h2># JavaScript Gradebook</h2>
<p><h3>### What was a surprising moment for you in this Gradebook Kata?</h3>
I was surprised how easy it was to add to arrays as in other languages i have tried i have always thought that simple task was far too complicated</p>

<p><h3>### Did you go back and rewrite code as you got to new steps? Is there anything you would change about your final code?</h3>
I did a lot of rewriting as I struggled to see the directness the test was trying to go. I didn't like making a much of functions to help other functions as it seems like expanding the code for no reason</p>

<h2># Built-in Methods</h2>
<p><h3>### On a scale of 1 - 5, 5 means 'These built in methods are hard!' and 1 means 'Built in methods are easy.  Piece of cake' - how are you feeling following this Built-In-Methods kata? </h3>
3 i found it good as there was plenty to learn and i feel i have only scratched the surface but the syntax allwasys confused for for each one</p>

<p><h3>### What resources did you use to help you? How useful did you find them?</h3>
For the built in methods i watched a lot of youtube videos about each one as i find it easier to follow when i have someone doing it infront of me to understand it</p>
