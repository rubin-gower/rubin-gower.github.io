     <h1>personal values</h1>
     <p> my personal value i find important is Adventure as you have to be able to understand meany different things before you set your mind on something. for example trying a bunch of different things before you decide to commit time to it like studying IT.</p>


     <p>my strengths are i have been learning web development at college. as for my limitations i am not that great at english as i have dyslexia 
     when trying to work with people with resistance or tension i find the best way is to just leave it and avoid provoking eachother</p>

      # Mindfulness 

      <p><b>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? </b>
      no</p>

      <p><b>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   </b>
      it feels like a waist of time as you coud be geting stuff done but without it i tend to get distracted more</p>

      <p><b>What did you notice as you were meditating? </b>
      it was nice to have a break from thinking about important things</p>

      <p><b>How did you find the overall experience? </b>
      it was good to try relax and try not to worrie about stuff</p>

      <p><b>What's your daily habit commitment? </b>
      to spend more time off screens and just thinking </p>

      <h2>Listening and Looping </h2>

      <p><b>What was it like to be fully listened to? </b>
      missed this</p>

      <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>

      <p><b>What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? </b>
      i just used the given seorces and w3 schools when i got stuck</p>

      <p><b>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</b>
      yes i keeped with the time box</p>

      <p><b>If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  </b>
      i got stuck with the names of the event listeners as they didnt have names like rightclick and had context menu instead</p>

      <h2>The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer</h2>

      <p><b>Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?
      i fell like i mostly have an undestanding of the dom in the past as to use css u need a little understanding e.g. changing the background and then changing a div. </b>
    i thought the node part was intresting as i have never heard of it before </p>

    <p><b>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</b>

    i try just keep one studdy tab open at a time just to keep things simple</p>

    <h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>

    <p><b>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?</b>
    i feel like i have only scratched the surface of the dom and if i reserched more it would get extreamly complicated fast. but for the most part it was simple enough to get an understanding</p>

    <p><b>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</b>
    i didnt get stuck at all </p>

    <p><b>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.</b>
    yeah it was fun to change things like colors on a page</p>

      <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p><b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</b>
      According to studies by Carol Dweck having an understanding of neuroplasticity can help students understand there brain in not fixed. Its actually able to learn new things and change the way we already do them. For example someone with the mindset that they are dumb can understand that the brain dosnt work that way and they can learn much better.</p>

      <p><b>Discuss how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b>
      Understanding neuroplasticity can be extremely helpful for me as i struggle with dyslexia and have tried programs like this in the past to change the way i think and it has definitely helped</p>

      <p><b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</b>
      Being open minded to change and not giving up will definitely help as you know it will just be practice that strengthens your neuroplasticity</p>

      <p><b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b>
        https://www.lexercise.com/blog/neuroplasticity-research-on-dyslexia
      This was interesting as it says people with dyslexia have less neuroplasticity. This is why dyslexics have trouble with reading as you have to convey the letters to sounds then words</p>

      <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p><b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b>
      Growth mindset is like the willingness to learn. If you're doing something and think it's useless and a waste of your time you won't learn. You have to engage and try to learn. This is important for web development as as there is so many ways to do the same thing you have to be open minded to adapt to the fast changing web development</p>

      <p><b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
      I was kind of interested that it said it was good to struggle as i have always thought work smart not hard and try avoid things that are too challenging so this was good to learn</p>

      <p><b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
      Understanding that struggle is a good thing as once you serpase it the results will be much better than trying to avoid it</p>

      <p><b>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</b>
        https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/
      I thought i was interesting as it talks about people working hard to get validation from others and have them recognize there achievements.</p>

<p><b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b>its ok to ask for help. I try ask for as little help as possible as i find that it dosnt let you understand somthing fully. but i did get stuck and it was better to ask for help rather than turn to spegie code. i allso found its much better to try have fun with your code as normaly i lose focus but when i was enjoying it i could keep focused.</p>
<p><b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b>after making a database for my minesweeper i found out how easyly someone could make a malitus program to try steal information to there computer so i think its important to stay ethical</p>
<p><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>its good to have fun with your code and take it in your own direction as i did int he minesweeper task</p>
<p><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>it realy sucks when you get stuck as i would offen just tell myself i would do it tommrow and the tasks would stuck up and i wouldnt have fun. you just have to push though</p>
<p><b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b>core is important as it allows you to refect and think about what you have achived and ways you could have done it better</p>
<p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer. </b>i do feel like i should be spending more time programing as i done fined core rewarding as i have to do some much spell checking becouse of my bad grammer and its still unreadble alot and not fun</p>
