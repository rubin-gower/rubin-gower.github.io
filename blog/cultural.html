 <p> my personal value i find important is Adventure as you have to be able to understand meany different things before you set your mind on something. for example trying a bunch of different things before you decide to commit time to it like studying IT.</p>


<p>my strengths are i have been learning web development at college. as for my limitations i am not that great at english as i have dyslexia 
when trying to work with people with resistance or tension i find the best way is to just leave it and avoid provoking eachother</p>

      # Mindfulness 

<h3>Have you done mindfulness or attention training before? </h3>
<p>no</p>

<h3>Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?   </h3>
<p>it feels like a waist of time as you coud be geting stuff done but without it i tend to get distracted more</p>

<h3>What did you notice as you were meditating? </h3>
<p>it was nice to have a break from thinking about important things</p>

<h3>How did you find the overall experience? </h3>
<p>it was good to try relax and try not to worrie about stuff</p>

<h3>What's your daily habit commitment? </h3>
<p>to spend more time off screens and just thinking </p>

<h2>Listening and Looping </h2>

<h3>What was it like to be fully listened to? </h3>
<p>missed this</p>

<h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>

<h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>

<h3>What did you notice about your learning style? What resources worked for you and why? </h3>
<p>i just used the given seorces and w3 schools when i got stuck</p>

<h3>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?</h3>
<p>yes i keeped with the time box</p>

<h3>If you did this entire exercise again, would you get stuck at the same points as you did the first time? Where did you get stuck?  </h3>
<p>i got stuck with the names of the event listeners as they didnt have names like rightclick and had context menu instead</p>

<h2>The DOM Primer and DevTools Primer</h2>

<h3>Were you interested or bored during this exercise? Which parts were interesting? Which parts were boring?
i fell like i mostly have an undestanding of the dom in the past as to use css u need a little understanding e.g. changing the background and then changing a div. </h3>

<p>i thought the node part was intresting as i have never heard of it before </p>

<h3>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
<h3><p>
i try just keep one studdy tab open at a time just to keep things simple</p>

<h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>

<h3>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths and limitations when doing this crash course?</h3>
i feel like i have only scratched the surface of the dom and if i reserched more it would get extreamly complicated fast. but for the most part it was simple enough to get an understanding

<h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
i didnt get stuck at all </h3>

<h3>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name or some inappropriate words into the DOM of a website? If not, do so now. It's hilarious and a great way to amuse your non-technical friends. They will think you are a hacker wizard.</h3>
<p>yeah it was fun to change things like colors on a page</p>
