   		  <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa </h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em>  </h2>
    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
    
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

   		<h1>The scroll bar</h1>
   		<p>After looking into custom scroll bars I found that they are not very customizable.  the parts you can customize are the button, track, track piece, thumb. The reason it's hard to style is because limited style effects can be used. For example I can't change the scroll bars height for my page. this gives a weird effect making it look like you cant scroll down to the bottom</p>

        <h1>HTML and CSS </h1>
        <p>html would have to be the bones of a project and and the css would be the skin. java script would be the mucces that actually makes the page move</p>
        <h1>flow and loops </h1>
        <p>loops are a super useful part of programming as it allows you to run code multiple times without typing it over and over. flow control is like the if else statements as if a certain condition is met e.g. making coffee you use flow control as if you have coffee beans in the pot then turn the machine on. if not then put beans in the machine. you also use loops as you add sugar to your coffee taste it and if it is still too strong you add more sugar and repeat until you like it</p>
        <h1>DOM </h1>
        <p>The best way I can think of describing the dom is that it's like layers on the first layer you have the main content then you add layers on top like the image below. The dom can be edited live. this allows you to change things on your website with javascript like click a button to reveal answers<br><img src="imgs/dom.png" width="300px"></p>
        <h1>arrays and objects </h1>
        <p>The difference between an array and an object is objects are good at storing data for many different points of data e.g. name lastname age.. whereas arrays are more for a single type of data like a list of names rather than the other details. to get data out of an array you would use the arrays name and where the specific data is e.g. aray[4] where as with objects you use the name then the data you want to use e.g. object.name</p>
        <h1>functions </h1>
        <p>functions are great as they are like a little sniped of code that you can call and it will run or return data</p>

      <p><h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        Pseudocode is where you comment what you want your program to do in simple terms. eg. add players distance * time</p>
      <p><h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
        the subber ducky method is where you talk about about the problem out loud as if you where telling someone else about it. i find this verry helpfull as i allways find out what i have done wrong when telling someone else about the problem</p>
      <p><h2>Reading error messages</h2>
        errer mesages are good for sintax errors and can tell you what line the problem accours on too</p>
      <p><h2>Console.logging</h2>
        the console is good for finding out what varibles values are or when somthings gets triggerd. for example i used this when making my easter egg when u hover over my name on the website to understand when to go rainbow</p>
      <p><h2>Googling</h2>
        googling problems is my go too when im stuck or dont know what an error message means. its allso good to see how other people have programed the same thing you have and to see if yours could be inproved</p>
      <p><h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
        its allso good to get someone to check your good to see if there is somthing you have overlookded or missed</p>
      <p><h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
        i find that by coding myself I do things in a realy bad way as i dont have the experiance and just little bits of information can go a long way</p>
      <p><h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
        anytime after programing somthing i allwasys feel i could start again and get it done in half the time thats why i think planing is important</p>
